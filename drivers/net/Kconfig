config NET_PPP_DRV_NAME
	string "PPP Driver name"
	default "ppp"
	depends on NET_PPP_UART
	help
	  This option sets the driver name

config NET_PPP_UART_PIPE_BUF_LEN
	int "Buffer length when reading from UART"
	default 8
	help
	  This options sets the size of the UART pipe buffer where data
	  is being read to.

config NET_PPPOE
	bool "Enable PPP over Ethernet"
	depends on NET_L2_ETHERNET
	help
	  Support PPP over Ethernet links. This option will cause ppp
	  specific network interface to be created. All the packets sent
	  to it will be directed to real Ethernet network interface.

config NET_PPPOE_SERVICE_NAME
	string "Service name"
	default ""
	depends on NET_PPPOE
	help
	  This option sets the PPPoE service name that is set in Discovery
	  messages. This can be left empty which indicates that any service is
	  acceptable

config NET_PPPOE_DRV_NAME
	string "PPPoE Driver name"
	default "pppoe"
	depends on NET_PPPOE
	help
	  This option sets the PPPoE driver name

config	NET_PPPOE_ETH_DRV_NAME
	string "Name of the Ethernet device"
	depends on NET_PPPOE
	help
	  This setting binds PPP over this Ethernet device. If this is left
	  empty, then first Ethernet device is used instead.

config NET_PPPOE_DELAY_STARTUP_MS
	int "Delay in ms before sending 1st Discovery"
	default 0
	depends on NET_PPPOE
	help
	  Delay the sending of first PPPoE Discovery packet. This is useful in
	  debugging. The value is in milliseconds. Value 0 disables the wait.

config NET_PPPOE_MAX_WAIT_IN_DISCOVERY
	int "Max delay in sec between two Discovery packets"
	default 60
	depends on NET_PPPOE
	help
	  When we do not receive a PADO packet within a specified amount
	  of time, we will resend PADI packet and double the waiting
	  period. This value tells the maximum wait. The value is in seconds.

config NET_PPP_MTU
	int "PPP MTU"
	default 1500
	range 80 1500
	help
	  This option sets the MTU for the PPP connection.
	  The value is only used when fragmenting the network
	  data into net_buf's.

config NET_PPP_VERIFY_FCS
	bool "Verify that received FCS is valid"
	default y
	help
	  If you have a reliable link, then it might make sense
	  to disable this as it takes some time to verify the received
	  packet.

config NET_PPP_CALC_FCS
	bool "Calculate FCS for the sent packet"
	default y
	help
	  If you have a reliable link, then it might make sense
	  to disable this as it takes some time to calculate the FCS for
	  the sent packet.

config	PPP_MAC_ADDR
	string "MAC address for the interface"
	help
	  Specify a MAC address for the PPP interface in the form of
	  six hex 8-bit chars separated by colons (e.g.:
	  aa:33:cc:22:e2:c0).  The default is an empty string, which
	  means the code will make 00:00:5E:00:53:XX, where XX will be
	  random.

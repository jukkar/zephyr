Zephyr HTTP Server
==================

Overview
--------

This sample application demonstrates the use of the ``http_server`` library. This library provides high-level functions to simplify and abstract server implementation. The server supports the HTTP/1.1 protocol and can also be upgraded to HTTP/2.

Requirement
-----------

`QEMU Networking <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/connectivity/networking/qemu_setup.html#networking-with-qemu>`_

Building and running the server
-------------------------------

To build and run the application:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ west build -p auto -b <board_to_use> -t run samples/net/sockets/http_server

When the server is up, we can make requests to the server using either HTTP/1.1 or HTTP/2 protocol from the host machine.

**With HTTP/1.1:**

- Using a browser: ``http://192.0.2.1:8080/``
- Using curl: ``curl -v --compressed http://192.0.2.1:8080/``
- Using ab (Apache Bench): ``ab -n10 http://192.0.2.1:8080/``

**With HTTP/2:**

- Using nghttp client: ``nghttp -v --no-dep http://192.0.2.1:8080/``
- Using curl: ``curl --http2 -v --compressed http://192.0.2.1:8080/``
- Using h2load: ``h2load -n10 http://192.0.2.1:8080/``

Server Customization
---------------------

The server contains several parameters that can be customized based on the requirements. These are the configurable parameters:

- ``HTTP_SERVER_SERVICE_PORT``: Configures Service Port.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_MAX_CLIENTS``: Defines the maximum number of HTTP/2 clients that the server can handle simultaneously.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_MAX_STREAMS``: Specifies the maximum number of HTTP/2 streams that can be established per client.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_CLIENT_BUFFER_SIZE``: Defines the buffer size allocated for each client.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_MAX_RESPONSE_SIZE``: Sets the maximum size of an HTTP response that the server can handle.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_MAX_URL_LENGTH``: Specifies the maximum length of an HTTP URL that the server can process.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_MAX_FRAME_SIZE``: Determines the maximum size of an HTTP/2 frame that the server can handle.

- ``HTTP_SERVER_POST_REQUEST_STORAGE_LIMIT``: Sets the maximum size limit for handling POST requests.

To customize these options, we can run ``west build -t menuconfig``, which provides us with an interactive configuration interface. Then we could navigate from the top-level menu to: ``-> Subsystems and OS Services -> Networking -> Network Protocols``.

Performance Analysis
--------------------

CPU Usage Profiling
*******************

We can use ``perf`` to collect statistics about the CPU usage of our server with the ``stat`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo perf stat -p <pid_of_server>

``perf stat`` will then start monitoring our server. We can let it run while sending requests to our server. Once we've collected enough data, we can stop ``perf stat``, which will print a summary of the performance statistics.

Hotspot Analysis
****************

``perf record`` and ``perf report`` can be used together to identify the functions in our code that consume the most CPU time:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo perf record -g -p <pid_of_server> -o perf.data

After running our server under load (For example, using ApacheBench tool), we can stop the recording and analyze the data using:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo perf report -i perf.data

After generating a file named ``perf.data`` which contains the profiling data, we can visualize it using ``FlameGraph`` tool. It's particularly useful for identifying the most expensive code-paths and inspect where our application is spending the most time.

To do this, we need to convert the ``perf.data`` to a format that ``FlameGraph`` can understand:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ sudo perf script | ~/FlameGraph/stackcollapse-perf.pl > out.perf-folded

And, then, generate the ``FlameGraph``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ ~/FlameGraph/flamegraph.pl out.perf-folded > flamegraph.svg

We can view flamegraph.svg using a web browser.
